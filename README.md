## A recopilation of some of the assigments for the subject "Seguridad en redes y sistemas informáticos" de U-tad del año 2017-2018.

*Note: all documents are written in Spanish.*

### Assignment 1 ([take me!](https://github.com/minicatsCB/practicas-seguridad/blob/master/Practica1.pdf))
- Search and analyze important global cyberattacks performed between 2016 and 2017. Indicate method of attack, target of the attack, affected countries and duration. Example: WannaCry (2017.
- Research about NSA actions and surveillance programs. Analyze the techniques, procedures and cooperations used.
- Analyze some projects of the NSA ANT catalog and TAO division. Example: GINSU (a backdoor).
- Identify how is the Defense in Depth (DiD) model implanted in current organizations.
- Install and use the TOR browser to access the Deep Web. Investigate the existence of search engines in TOR and use them.
- Identify the different types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Examples: ICMP flood, Smurf attack, SYN flood.
- Use OpenSSL to cipher a text with DES, 3DES and AES cipher algorithms. What is, what does it serve for and how can you use symmetric cipher.
- Generate private and public keys for asymmetric cipher. How can you use it for an SSH connection?
- Use OpenSSL to obtain the hash of a string with MD5 and SHA1 hash functions.
- Investigate the main steganography techniques. Example of use with `steghide`.
- Give an overview of the risk assessment in the IT systems of an organization.
- Analyze the main differences between ISO 27001:2005 and 27001:2013.
- Analyze the different phases of the OWASP methodology.

### Assignment 2 ([take me!](https://github.com/minicatsCB/practicas-seguridad/blob/master/Practica2.pdf))
- Develop a tool with Python to gather information on a target automatically (not attached).
- Make custom dorks to gather information about devices and applications.
- Extract information from metadata of files from any public organization- Example: using [Foca](https://www.elevenpaths.com/es/labstools/foca-2/index.html).
- Systems intrusion: information gathering, vulnerability detection, use of Metasploit.

### Assignment 3 ([take me!](https://github.com/minicatsCB/practicas-seguridad/blob/master/Practica3.pdf))
- Web attacks: XSS, SQL Injection, Directory Traversal. Examples: OWASP virtual machine and Acunetix web application.
- Application mapping and analysis, vulnerability detection, obtaining users and credentials of a web application, access to the system, post-exploitation.

### Assignment 4 ([take me!](https://github.com/minicatsCB/practicas-seguridad/blob/master/Practica4.pdf))
- Most common open ports in routers. Example: Telnet (port 23), DNS (port 53), HTTP (port 80).
- Some bugs in routers
- Wireshark: detection of some attacks. Example: ARP spoofing, port flooding, DDos attacks.
- Man in the middle (MiTM) attacks. Example: capture the search query and user credentials sent through HTTP (not HTTPS) protocol
- Wireless encryption methods: WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPS.

### Final project: Wireless networks attacks ([take me!](https://github.com/minicatsCB/practicas-seguridad/blob/master/TrabajoFinalAtaquesClientesWi-fi.pdf))
- Analysis of different kinds of wireless encryption methods: WEP, WPA, WPA2.
- Identification of types of attacks for each method. For example: MAC spoofing, MiTM, DoS, etc.
. Security measures. For example: SSID hiding, MAC ID filtering, WIDS, WIPS, etc.
- Execution and reproduction of attacks. For example: Evil Twin attack with captive portal. Use of Aircrack-ng (manual mode) and Wifiphisher (automatic mode).
- Practical demo (not attached).
